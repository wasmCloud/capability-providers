# Pre-OTP Capability Providers
## ⚠️ DEPRECATED
All of the providers in this folder were written to be compatible with version `0.18` and _earlier_ of the wasmCloud host runtime. These providers are deprecated and are **not** compatible with version `0.50` and _later_ of the runtime.

We have kept this directory around _temporarily_ so that people can use it as a reference during the transition period but this folder will ultimately be removed.
